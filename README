ADB HID caps lock hack

This patch will add a kernel option (CONFIG_ADBHID_CAPSLOCK) to make caps lock
act (mostly) as a regular caps lock instead of as a brain-dead ADB caps lock. I
got the 2.4 patch from [1], which is by Gregorio Gervas,  and adapted it for
the 2.6 kernel. The 2.6 patch has been tested in 2.6.11.10, but will probably
apply cleanly to previous (and later) 2.6 kernels as well.
